### 📁 Project Structure

* *   We created a folder named `App` in the root directory.
*     
* *   Then we added a dunder file (`__init__.py`) to make it a **package**.
*

## 📚 Key Concepts Learned

### 🧩 Modules vs Packages

* *   **Module**: A single Python file (e.g., `main.py`) is considered a module.
*     
* *   **Package**: A folder that contains a collection of modules. To make a folder a package, it must contain a `__init__.py` file.
*     

* * *

### 🌐 Understanding APIs and URLs

* *   In APIs, the **Base URL** refers to the root address (e.g., `https://gemini.google.com`).
*     
* *   The **"/"** path is called the **entry point** of our server; it usually returns the **home page**.
*     

* * *

### 🔒 What is HTTPS?

* *   HTTPS is a **scheme** used in APIs. It operates on a **request/response cycle** and ensures secure communication over the network.
